- By default, django assigns 'id' as the primary key field for a model, but if you manually assign another field as the primary key, then pk will refer to that field.
- pk is a special parameter for django that refers to the primary key field on the model.


from django.db import models
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404

CASE-1:
-------
class UserModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField('Name', max_length=20)
    email = models.EmailField('Email', max_length=100)

In above model, we did not define any primary key, so django will create id as a primary key by default.

user1 = get_object_or_404(UserModel, id=id)
user2 = get_object_or_404(UserModel, pk=id)

**Output of user1 and user2 will same, because pk will also refer to id field in this case.

CASE-2:
-------
class UserModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField('Name', max_length=20)
    email = models.EmailField('Email', max_length=100, primary_key=True)

In above model, we define email as primary key, so django will not create id as a primary key by default and email will be our primary key for UserModel.

user1 = get_object_or_404(UserModel, id=id)
user2 = get_object_or_404(UserModel, pk=id)

**Output of user1 and user2 will not same, because id will refer to id field but now, pk will refer to email field in this case.
